<h1>Questions belong to StackOverflow</h1>
<p>GitHub is for issues and feature requests. Anything else belongs to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=skrollr">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<h1>Pull requests</h1>
<p>Will be ignored if the Travis build fails. Install grunt and run <code>grunt jshint qunit</code> locally before submitting pull requests.</p>
<p>Do not include build files in your pull request (e.g. <code>skrollr.min.js</code>).</p>
<p>Do not change the version number in your pull request.</p>
<p>Do not try to fix multiple issues or add multiple features with a single pull request. A pull request should only do one thing.</p>
